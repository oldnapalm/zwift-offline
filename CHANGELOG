# Only breaking changes in releases will be documented here.

Update to Zwift_1.0.150097:
  * This update requires Zwift Launcher 1.1.14 which replaces Zwift's cacert.pem. You will need
    to re-append cert-zwift-com.pem to Zwift's cacert.pem.


Update to Zwift_1.0.100317:
  * The Windows client launcher now uses Edge instead of Internet Explorer and the zoffline SSL
    certificate is no longer accepted. The certificate has been replaced and as a consequence
    you will need to configure the client again using the new certificate (Step 2 in README.md)
    after updating zoffline.
    See https://github.com/zoffline/zwift-offline/issues/154 for details.


Update to Zwift_1.0.100133:
  * Changes were made to Zwift's cacert.pem. You will need to re-append cert-zwift-com.pem
    to Zwift's cacert.pem.


Update to Zwift_1.0.60239:
  * With the update to this Zwift release, zoffline has included significant changes
    to fully support a multiplayer mode, pace partners, and more.
  * New dependencies required if running from source: pyJWT, flask-login, FlaskSQLAlchemy, gevent
    * Install these with ``pip install pyjwt flask-login flask_sqlalchemy gevent``
  * Multi-profile support has been deprecated in favor of full multiplayer support.
    * See Step 6 in README.md for how to enable multiplayer support.
      * Create an account for each profile you had and upload their profile.bin
        and credential files via the new Zwift launcher.
  * Do not "upgrade" from an existing single player installation to multiplayer and then
    "downgrade" back to single player without backing up your original storage directory.
    You will lose your activities, segment results, and goals if you do this and don't
    have a backup to restore from.


Update to Zwift_1.0.51959:
  * Changes were made to Zwift's cacert.pem. You will likely need to re-append
    cert-zwift-com.pem to Zwift's cacert.pem in a specific way.
    See https://github.com/zoffline/zwift-offline/issues/62 for details.
